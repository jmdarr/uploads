Upload script, originally designed for images. Consists of:

1. upload.html - The page giving you the form to upload the file.
2. upload.php - The form processor.
3. uploads/ - Configured in upload.php, this is the directory where images will be stored.
4. uploads/index.php - A quick and simple image gallery display script.

In regards to the gallery display script, you must have imagemagick installed, as well
